  <h1>WELCOME TO LAGOS</h1>
  <h4>AFRICA'S MODEL MEGACITY</h4>

  <h2>THE HISTORY OF LAGOS<h2>
<h1>Colonial-era<h1>
   <p>Modern-day Lagos was founded by the Awori in the thirteenth century. It was later called Eko.The Portuguese explorer Ruy de Sequeira who visited the area in 1472, named the area around the city Lago de Curamo; the present name is Portuguese for "lakes".</p>
<h5>Post Colonial</h5>
<p>When the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria was established in 1914 Lagos was declared its capital. Lagos experienced rapid growth throughout the 1960s and 1970s as a result of Nigeria's economic boom prior to the Biafran War. This continued through the 1980s and 1990s up to the present date.</p>
<p>Lagos was the capital of Nigeria from 1914 - 1991 when the capital was moved to Abuja. Abuja is a capital like Washington, DC in United States and Brasilia in Brazil in that it was built from scratch specifically to be a capital.In 1991, Ibrahim Babangida, the Military President and other government functions moved to the newly built capital. This was as a result of intelligence reports on the safety of his life and what was later to be termed his hidden agenda, which was the plan to turn himself into a civilian president. He finished what was started by the Murtala/Obasanjo regime. The change resulted in Lagos losing some prestige and economic leverage. However, it has retained its importance as the country's largest city and as an economic centre</p>

      <h2>Points of INTERESTS</h2>

<p>Beaches</p>
<p>Two kilometers southwest of the town center, Praia do Camilo is the postcard favorite. Framed by outcrops of fantastic rock formations, this sheltered slither of sand is illuminated in spring by a mantle of colorful flowers that cling to the cliff edge above. Arrive early during the summer to bag a spot, and note that by late afternoon, the beach is cast in shadow as the sun starts to dip behind the promontory.</p><p>The vast Meia Praia starts its run behind the marina and stretches four kilometers to the east. Its name in English means "Half Beach" - a curious moniker given that this is the longest beach in the region. For sun-seekers, however, this translates as more sand, and there's ample space to relax and bronze up. It's an exposed beach, though, and popular with water sports enthusiasts. A number of restaurants line the dunes and a regular bus service from Avenida dos Descobrimentos serves its entire length.</p><p>Out of town lies Porto de Mós. A fabulous coastal footpath leading from the Ponta da Piedade lighthouse will take walkers to this lovely beach, but allow an hour to hike the trail.</p>
<p>Kayak Tours along the Coast</p>
<p> The coastline west out of Lagos is straight out of a pirate adventure picture book. The scenic, honeycombed cliffs; weird chimneystack rock formations; and the dozens of hidden sea caves and ancient grottos at Ponte da Piedade make for exhilarating exploration and are tourist attractions in themselves.</p><p>One of the most exciting ways of charting a course along this incredible seascape is by joining a guided kayak and snorkel trip excursion. Paddle out over warm turquoise shallows for fisheye-views of this wonderfully evocative environment. Later, plunge into the Atlantic's alluring waters and marvel at the undersea world alive beneath you. Between forays, kayakers have the chance to soak up the sun on a deserted beach</p>
<p>Parque Aventura Lagos</p>
<p>A radical activity attraction for all the family, the Lagos Adventure Park is all about following high ropes courses set at different heights and at various degrees of difficulty through a canopy of swaying, lofty trees.<br>Testing nerves and physical ability, daredevil patrons have to surmount a number of challenges along the way, such as traversing bridges, navigating rope nets, and riding giant ziplines. The ropes courses are set at three levels of complexity: Curious, Adventurous, or Fearless.</p>
<p>Parque Zoológico de Lagos</p>
<p>Rubber-limbed gibbons, marble-eyed lemurs, and fur ball marmosets are just some of the animals waiting to greet visitors at Lagos Zoo. Joining the primates in this semitropical park, approximately eight kilometers north of Lagos, are other residents, like the sleek bobcat, and rare species such as Indian muntjac deer. Heading up the entertainment is a troupe of cheeky meerkats.</p>
<p>The variety of birdlife is impressive, and the colorful and exotic flocks include channel-billed toucans, rainbow lorikeets, and the wonderfully named chattering lory. Owls and assorted waterfowl can also be admired.In addition, the zoo's countryside setting is an ideal showcase for its farm stock: animals like sheep, goats, and horses.</p>
<p>It has the Tallest Building in West Africa</p>
<p>Lagos state hosts the tallest building in West Africa, NECOM house towers and it is 160m above the city.AS a result it can handle majority of Nigeria's imports. Located in the Southwest beach line of Nigeria, Lagos port is responsible for processing 80% of goods in Nigeria.</p>
<p> Marina de Lagos</p>
<p>Yachts and motorboats of all shapes and sizes tie up at this first-class mooring facility, but Lagos Marina provides far more than just a safe haven for visiting watercraft. Anchored along the boardwalk are several very good eateries where customers can relax and soak in the seaside atmosphere. At night, some of these cafés host live music performances.Numerous coastal cruise companies are based here, offering anything from exhilarating sightseeing excursions to the rock stacks, sea caves, and grottoes around Ponta da Piedade to fantastic dolphin "seafaris" that head out into the bay</p>
<p>Igreja de Santa Maria-Praça do Infante D. Henrique</p>
<p>Lending dynamic perspective to Praça do Infante D. Henrique is the late 15th-century church of St. Mary. Set in the northwestern corner of the square, the church still retains a Renaissance doorway, which fortunately survived the great earthquake of 1755.

The building was renovated during the latter half of the 16th century and considerably expanded in the 18th century, so what visitors see today is an interesting amalgamation of architectural styles</p>

  <h2>THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT LAGOS-FACTS<h2>
    <p>Let's Take a goood look at the Most top 8 popular attractions you need to know about LAGOS-<i>Africa's Model Mega City.</i></p>
    <section>
      <p>Lagos was initially called EKO</p>
      <p>Lagos was called Eko before colonisation by locals. It served as a major centre for slave-trade, from which then Oba of Benin Ado and all of his successors for over four centuries supported - until 1841 when Oba Akitoye ascended to the throne of Lagos and attempted to ban slave-trading. Local merchants strongly opposed the intended move, and deposed, exiled the king and installed Akitoye's brother Kosoko as Oba.</p>
        <p>Lagos's geographic boundary was Lagos Mainland</p>
    <p>Until the coming of the Benins, Lagos's geographic boundary was Lagos Mainland. Lagos Island, the seat of the Oba of Lagos, then consisted of a pepper farm and fishing posts. No one lived there. The name Eko was given to it by its first king, Oba Ado, during its early history. Lagos also saw periods of rule by the Kingdom of Benin.</P>
    <P>WATER</P>
    <P> Lagos and some few other states in Nigeria are those that can boast of being blessed with ocean fronts. Ondo state trumped them all by having the longest coastline about 180km - though untapped - it is bigger and larger than that of Lagos.</P>
    <P>Mineral resources.</P>
