  <h2>ENTERTAINMENT AND FASHION<h2>
    <h3>“The entertainment industry and the fashion in Nigeria have been interlinked for so long, back in the years. However, what probably started as getting dressed up for the theatre has evolved into intertwined fortunes in which entertainment drives fashion, and fashion drives entertainment.Let's take a good long on Entertainment and fashion in Different places;</h3>
<P>Film Industry<P>
  <p>Nigeria’s film industry produces 1,500 titles each year and is the largest in Africa. It is often referred to as ‘Nollywood’, not just as a reference to the other major international film production centre, but because it also references the idea of creating something out of very limited resources: ‘nothing wood’. Films are often produced with very tight turnaround times on small budgets. Nollywood’s output has allowed Africans to view films by other Africans, with storylines that often highlight common traditions and cultures or pressing social issues</p>
  <p>The Lagos State Employment Trust Fund was established in 2016 to promote the entrepreneurship necessary to create jobs and improve the economy. It has initial capital of approximately $68.5 million over four years, but is also seeking further support from donors, development agencies and businesses. All of the Trust Fund’s loans are delivered alongside capacity development work, which it provides in partnership the United Nations Development Programme</p><p>Nollywood—the Lagos-based Nigerian film industry—has become the third-largest film industry in the world, and it is by far the most powerful purveyor of an image of Nigeria to domestic and foreign populations</p>

<p>Music</p>
<p>The music sector of Nigeria’s entertainment industry also recorded significant growth over the years. The stakeholders include artists, musicians, producers, promoters, managers, distributors, marketers, etc. In the past six years, the growing numbers of new production studios and artists springing up has paved way for a more vibrant and self-sustaining industry. Others have won prestigious awards in international contests and events, hence attracting more and more investments from very many sources. The investments have no doubt aided production of world-class quality music because of innovations in sounds, rhythms and recording techniques. Pace-setters, Nigerian musicians have developed a vast spectrum of music genres, blending hip-hop, rap, rhythm and blues, reggae, gospel, etc. with traditional Nigerian genres.</p>
<p>The Nigerian government has taken some key steps to grow the media and entertainment industry. These include;Creation of the Creative Industry Financing Initiative,Internet Penetration Rate and Fibre Optics Deployment.</p>

<p>Culture</p>
<p>Nigeria is an extremely diverse country, with well over 1000 different ethnic groups residing within its territory. The 4 largest of these groups are the Hausa, the Fulani, the Igbo and the Yoruba. The culture of Nigeria is therefore every bit as diverse as you would expect from a country which is a melting pot of people from so many different backgrounds.In most urban areas, and particularly in the south of the country, both men and women tend to wear standard western-style clothing. Therefore in a business context, stylish suits for men and smart dresses or trouser suits for women are the norm.+</p>

<h2>TOURISM AND MINING<h2>
  <p>African countries are surrounded by coastal line which makes them more attractive to tourist, such like the beaches in Lagos, Nigeria, the world’s highest sand dunes in South Africa, the wild life experience in the safari in Tanzania. With these tourism po-tentials, it makes tourism very important in developing countries taking into considera-tion the untapped natural resources blessed within the shores of these African coun-tries.</p><p>The empirical part of this thesis involved the use of qualitative research method, which includes interviews and observations. The findings of this study revealed that the coastal line of Lagos as a tourist attraction has a positive economic impact on the peo-ple of the area in terms of job creation, income generation, infrastructural development and other positive elements.</p>

<h2>BUSINESS LIFE<h2>
<p>Lagos is a city that never sleeps, with a population of around 21 million people breathing life into its magnificence. Known for its booming economy and bustling culture, it’s perfect for both business travelers and vacationers alike. Its beauty grips you the moment you arrive and leaves an everlasting impression Stretching from as far as the Gulf of Guinea, reaching all the way to Lagos Lagoon, Nigeria’s biggest city is a traveler’s delight. You’re spoilt for choice when it’s time to unwind and explore the city and its surrounds. This is because Lagos not only consists of a mainland hub, but is also connected to two urban islands that you can reach via three major bridges or by ferry</p>
<p>Trading may be Lagos Island’s strong suit, but it is also rich in cultural hotspots. Among many attractions, it’s host to the National Museum of Nigeria – a perfect stop to find out more about the country’s rich history. Tinubu Square also comes highly recommended, as it’s where the Amalgamation ceremony of the North and South took place in 1914.There are also quieter, alternative beaches, which the locals prefer as their getaways from the city. These include Takwa Bay, Lighthouse Beach and Akodo Beach.  </p>

  <h2>JOBS<h2>
    <section>
      <p>It is no doubt that people are looking for jobs every day in Nigeria. The Nigerian environment is a paradox, millions of youthful lives wasted in search of job opportunities. Some say there are jobs, others oppose and say there are no jobs anywhere. The Nigerian Government says that they are working in the best interest of the youth, yet they throw sham testimonies at them.</p>
    <p>  Employment Generation through Entrepreneurial Education</p>
    <p> Entrepreneurial skill  acquisition  plays  a  significant  role  in  the generation  of  employment  opportunities. Entrepreneurship  as  a  purposeful  activity  is indulged in initiating,  promoting and maintaining economic activities for production and distribution of  goods  and  commodities</p>
    <p>Creating  an  Entrepreneurial Mindset </p>
     <p>Entrepreneurship  has been proven to  be a key ingredient of economic progress needed in all areas of  human  activities,  from  business  to  arts  [31]. Entrepreneurship does not relate only to skills and attitudes  required  for  creating  and  marketing profitably  new  products  and  innovative  services but  also  to  the  general  mind-set  accepted  and appreciated by all members of successful societies</p>

    <h2>Residents</h2>
    <p>While the state is essentially a Yoruba-speaking environment, it is a socio-cultural melting pot attracting both Nigerians and foreigners alike.

Indigenous inhabitants include the Aworis and Ogus in Ikeja and Badagry Divisions respectively, with the Eguns being found mainly in Badagry.

There is also an admixture of other pioneer settlers collectively known as the Ekos.[citation needed]

The indigenes of Ikorodu and Epe Divisions are mainly the Ijebus with pockets of Eko-Awori settlers along the coastland and riverine areas.</p>
